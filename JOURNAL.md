| 10:08:05 | Well, golang.<br>Let's see what's it all about on tour.golang.org | 
| 10:51:07 | Well...<br>No class statements... And Pointer stuff... getting nervous :-O | 
| 11:29:10 | First quick read of the basics done... <br>I need a break.<br>**Summary:** I have no idea what I'm doing | 
| 13:16:09 | Since I only have my Windows Tablet here, I'll dig out my dusty RasPi and set it up for golang... | 
| 14:03:46 | Headless RasPi is running a go "hello world".<br>VSCode with SSH plugin runs on the tablet.<br>First I have to take care of other things, maybe I'll continue tonight.<br>**Summary:** Basics done, ready for task-takeoff (later) | 
| 16:43:43 | Setup of Github repo done: https://github.com/solk42/GOrgeousPasswd<br>Added first task description as md file | 
| 16:49:00 | starting first attempt of basic generator function ... to be continued | 
| 17:03:39 | well... generating a not really random string works - need to lookup how to generate it more realrandomly :-/ | 
| 17:09:09 | that was easy - added rand.Seed with time function on each call.<br>**Summary:** First babystep of TASK-01-01 done, will continue later or tomorrow |
